      <h2> SUMMARY:</h2>
       <h5> 
          I am a driven, and passionate Web Developer working currently at SilverStripe, with a
          background in art and design. </br>
          I am currently specialised in front end development, though I am comfortable in back end development(PHP/SilverStripe).</br>

          I enjoy both leading and working within teams, as well as alone. 
          Having the experience to both design and building products really excites me. Technology is the way of the future, my passion is visually creating meaning that 
          interacts and connect with people.</br>
          I enjoy being curious and pushing the boundaries of technology and design that have endless possibilities, but I also have an empathetic approach to problems.</br>
          I often use empathy to explore the "why" and solve the "how".</br>
          I love the continous advances in technology and seeing it create better
          ways to solving problems for the community.</br>

          Right now, I am rebuilding a personal website, with technologies such as React, Pixi.js, Paper.Js, SilverStripe and (sass) Foundation.

        Enspiral Dev Academy is a practical bootcamp style web developing course where over one thousand hours
        is spent learning skills in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Jquery, Agile, HTML5, CSS3, and Git.</br>
        Agile and Engineering Empathy is the key focus area for soft skills and to help integrate workers into a realistic working environment, and learn how to work in teams in a commercial high pressure environment and deal with issues that might arise when working with others.</br>
        The course has a large emphasise on learning through doing. We pair from day one and every week we finish the week with a team project.
        Over the 18 weeks I built basic terminal apps, to full stack with web frame works such as rails.</br>
        The final project was called "Inkling" - A mind map app for creative ideas, this was an exploration project where art meets code.
        I really felt passionate about this project where I really immersed myself in the unknown of creativity and technology, stretching ideas of whats possible.
        Team work was the key for overall accomplishment.
        These experiences really reflected the importance of understanding people, which I believe uncovers the real problems in design and technology.</br>
        I also disovered a new found hobbie three.js which I quickly taught myself in the last week of the project. Note: link below works best in Safari.
