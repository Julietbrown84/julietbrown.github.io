               We are a multi-disciplinary team of curious design thinkers and doers working at the intersection of strategy and design. We are led by insights that inform great ideas to deliver incredible change.

                Today, innovative businesses are searching for problems to solve – problems that are less about business needs and more about the needs of people. The process of gaining insight into these problems, reframing them as opportunities, and finding creative user-centred solutions is how innovation comes about. This is also known as design thinking.

                As a design-led business ourselves, we know this process can be difficult. It requires confronting failure, exercising sometimes-uncomfortable levels of empathy, and having an open mind. However, it pays dividends. It provides the insight to see opportunities that competitors can’t, and paves the path for effective ways to leverage those opportunities.

          How to begin
          Despite the best of intentions, we often see projects stall shortly after the articulation of initial research and insights into the human-centred problems they are seeking to solve. Many companies lack the processes of experimenting, failing and learning to take opportunities to the next stage.

          Our business Chrysalis was formed to guide clients through this process of innovation. Chrysalis provides coached experiences that transfer insights and creativity into tangible business opportunities.

          While innovation might be easier said than done, it’s certainly not a mystery. It’s a process we are in the business of facilitating. It can be learned, experienced and practiced, for the delight of your customers and staff and the benefit of your business.
